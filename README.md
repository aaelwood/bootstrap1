# Personal Portfolio Website (bootstrap1) ü•≥

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This website is built using **HTML** and **CSS**, and showcases who I am, what I'm working on, and where I'm going. It's a great example of a basic but professional web presence using foundational front-end technologies.
